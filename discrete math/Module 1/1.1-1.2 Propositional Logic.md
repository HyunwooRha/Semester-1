# Proposition
- A proposition is declarative a statement that is either true or false
- It cannot be true and false at the same time
- Statements like ``x + 2 = 4`` are not propositions because they are not declarative
- Statements like ``1 + 1 = 2`` are propositions because they are declarative
- Statements like ``x + 2 = 4, where x is 2`` are propositions because they are declarative

## Propositional Variables
- A propositional variable is a variable that represents a proposition
- A statements can be represented by a propositional variable

# Compound Propositions
- Compound propositions are formed by combining propositions using logical operators
- These logical operators are called ``connectives``

# Variations of Conditional Statements
- Given that $p \rightarrow q$
  - converse: $q \rightarrow p$
  - inverse: $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$
  - contrapositive: $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$
## Connectives
- The ``negation`` of a proposition ``p`` is denoted by ``~p`` and is read as ``not p``
- The ``conjunction`` of propositions ``p`` and ``q`` is denoted by ``p ^ q`` and is read as ``p and q``
- The ``disjunction`` of propositions ``p`` and ``q`` is denoted by ``p v q`` and is read as ``p or q``
    - This is an inclusive operator
- The ``exclusive or`` of propositions ``p`` and ``q`` is denoted by ``p xor q`` and is read as ``p or q but not both``
  - This is the exclusive operator for ``disjunction``
  - Denoted by ``⨁``
- The ``implication`` of propositions ``p`` and ``q`` is denoted by ``p -> q`` and is read as ``if p then q``
- The ``biconditional`` of propositions ``p`` and ``q`` is denoted by ``p <-> q`` and is read as ``p if and only if q``
  - This can also be written as a conjunction of two implications
    - ``p <-> q`` is equivalent to ``(p -> q) ^ (q -> p)``
- The ``Contropositive`` of propositions ``p`` and ``q`` is denoted by ``~q -> ~p`` and is read as ``if not q then not p``

## Truth Tables
- Each row of a truth table gives us one possiblity for the truth values of the propositions.

*Note that the truth table for implication and contropositive are the same*

# Logical Equivalences
- Two compound propositions are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth values for all possible truth values of their propositional variables
- We can use truth tables to determine if two compound propositions are logically equivalent

# Keywords
- ``Necessary``: "p is necessary for q" means $q \rightarrow p$
- ``Sufficient``: "p is sufficient for q" means $p \rightarrow q$
  - "p is necessary and sufficient for q" means $p \leftrightarrow q$
- ``only if``: "p only if q" means $p \rightarrow q$
  - Note that this is not the same as ``if and only if``
- ``unless``: "p unless q" means $\neg q \rightarrow p$
  - Interchangable with ``if not q then p``

# Order of Operations
- The order of operations for logical operators is as follows:
  1. Negation ($\neg$)
  2. Conjunction ($\wedge$)
  3. Disjunction ($\vee$)
  4. Implication ($\rightarrow$)
  5. Biconditional ($\leftrightarrow$)
- We can use parentheses to change the order of operations, they have the highest precedence
