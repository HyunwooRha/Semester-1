# Sequences
## Defining a Sequence
- A proper definition of a sequence requires us to define *all* terms in the sequence, not just finitely many of them.
  - This can be done either directly or recursively.
  - A direct definition gives each $a_n$ as a function of $n$. We often just give an equation for $a_n$ without quantifying "for all $n \in \mathbb{N_0}$".

## Sequences as Functions
- A sequence is a special kind of function, namely a function whose domain is $N_0$.

### Arithmetic Sequences
- A sequence that has a constant difference between successive terms is called **arithmetic**.
  - $a_n = a_0 + nd$
  - This is for zero based numbering

### Geometric Sequences
- A sequence that has a constant ratio between successive terms is called **geometric**.
  - $a_n = a_0r^n$
  - This is for zero based numbering

## Recursive Definition
- A recursive definition gives each term of a sequence as a function of previous sequence terms.
  - $a_n = f(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, ..., a_{n-k})$

### An example of a multi-step recursive definition
- The **Fibonacci Sequence** is the sequence $0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,...$.
- $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$

## Sums of Consecurive Integers
- The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
  - $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

## Handling Sigma Sums that do not start at lower index 1
- When we have a summation formua for $\sum_{i=1}^n f(k)$, we can use it to compute sums of the form $\sum_{i=m}^n f(k)$ through subtraction:
  - $\sum_{i=m}^n f(k) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(k) - \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} f(k)$

## Sums of Consecutive Squares
- The sum of the first $n$ squares is $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.
  - $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$
  
## Telescoping Sums
- A **telescoping sum** is a sum in which many terms cancel out.
