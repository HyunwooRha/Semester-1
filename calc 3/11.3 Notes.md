# Partial Derivatives
- If $(x_0, y_0)$ is in domain of $f$, the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ at $(x_0, y_0)$ is
  - $f_x(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}$, provided the limit exists.
- If $(x_0, y_0)$ is in domain of $f$, the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ at $(x_0, y_0)$ is
  - $f_y(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + h) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}$, provided the limit exists.
